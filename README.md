🚀 Just Completed My Excel Dashboard Project! 📊
I'm excited to share my latest project as part of my Data Management course – an interactive Excel Dashboard that brings data to life!
In this project, I worked with key Excel tools like:
 ✅ Pivot Tables & Charts
 ✅ Power Pivot 
 ✅ Lookup & Logical Functions
 ✅ Conditional Formatting
This dashboard helps users visualize complex data in a clean, insightful, and user-friendly way. Whether it’s performance tracking, sales analytics, or business KPIs – it's all just a few clicks away!
💡 Through this project, I’ve learned how powerful Excel can be for turning raw data into meaningful insights.
I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Always open to learning and growing!
